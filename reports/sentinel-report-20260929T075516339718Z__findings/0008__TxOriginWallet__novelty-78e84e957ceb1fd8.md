# TxOriginWallet: privilege-boundary-outlier

- **Severity:** medium
- **Location:** `src/TxOriginWallet.sol:11`

## Observation
This public state-changing function sits beside privileged controls but declares no recognizable access modifier; review the intended authorization model.

## Evidence
- Privileged-control indicators exist in the contract source
- Public/external function has a state-change signal without a recognized modifier
- Source heuristic only; authorization may be enforced internally.

## Status
Scout candidate; no exploit or patch has been approved yet.
